# Stream Buddy

An Android pre-play cache and cache-first player for HLS and direct media streams.

Stream Buddy does one thing: it downloads the first part of a stream **before** you press play, so
playback starts from local storage instead of the network — and it keeps caching as you watch.

```
Queue a stream  ──▶  WorkManager job  ──▶  Media3 SimpleCache (2 GB LRU)
                                                    ▲
Player tab      ──▶  ExoPlayer, cache-first  ───────┘
```

## Status

CI (`.github/workflows/android.yml`) compiles the app, runs the unit tests and packages a debug
APK on every pull request; the APK is uploaded as the `stream-buddy-debug-apk` artifact of the run.
It has **not** been exercised on a physical device yet, so playback edge cases are untested — see
the limitations below.

## What works

| Area | Behaviour |
| --- | --- |
| **Queue** | Add an HLS playlist (`.m3u8`), a DASH manifest (`.mpd`) or a media file (`.mp4`, `.mkv`, …). Title is optional and derived from the URL when blank. Live cache state, progress, errors, retry and delete. |
| **Pre-caching** | HLS: resolves the master playlist to a variant, then caches segments covering the configured pre-play window (2/5/10/20 min), including `#EXT-X-MAP` init segments and `#EXT-X-BYTERANGE` sub-ranges. Progressive files: caches the first 25 % of the file (8 MB – 150 MB). Runs in the background with a low-priority progress notification and resumes after retries or cancellation. |
| **DRM** | FairPlay, Widevine, PlayReady and CENC are detected from the playlist/manifest and never cached. Ordinary HLS `AES-128` encryption is *not* DRM and stays cacheable. |
| **Playback** | ExoPlayer reads through the same cache, so pre-cached data is used immediately and everything else is cached as it plays (HLS segments always; progressive files when the server reports a length). HLS/DASH manifests deliberately bypass the cache so live playlists never go stale. |
| **Apps** | Lists launchable apps with streaming services first; tapping one opens it. DRM services only play inside their own app, so Stream Buddy launches them instead of pretending it can cache them. |
| **Smart pre-cache** | An on-device model ranks the queue, predicts which stream you will open next (series + episode order, recency, how often you finish, time of day) and pre-caches the best guess deeply and two runner-ups shallowly — on Wi-Fi, while charging. Every prediction shows the reasons behind it and can be switched off. |
| **Settings** | Smart pre-cache on/off + model status, pre-play window, cache quality (lowest/highest HLS variant), cache usage and clearing, notification permission, version/about. |

## Honest limitations

* **DRM streaming services** (Netflix, Disney+, Prime Video, Max, …) cannot be pre-cached. Their
  apps are launch-only.
* **DASH** (`.mpd`) playback is supported; *pre-caching* MPDs is not implemented yet (the queue
  reports "Playback only" for those URLs).
* **Live HLS** is cached best-effort from the newest segments of the playlist snapshot. There is
  no DVR/timeshift support.
* **No background audio**: playback pauses when the app is backgrounded, because no
  `MediaSessionService`/notification transport controls are published yet.
* Cache eviction is LRU inside a fixed 2 GB budget (`CacheManager.MAX_BYTES`); deleting a queue
  entry does not evict its cached segments directly — "Clear cache" in Settings does.

## What the "AI" actually is

No cloud, no LLM, no data leaving the phone. Pre-play caching needs a decision in milliseconds,
offline, on a device with no reliable GPU access — so the model is a nine-feature logistic
regressor (`ai/PrefetchPredictor.kt`, ~350 lines) that starts from hand-tuned priors and refits
itself from the playbacks recorded on this device:

| Feature | What it captures |
| --- | --- |
| `NEXT_EPISODE` | the queued stream is SxxEyy right after what you last watched |
| `SAME_SERIES` | same show/film as your last session |
| `RECENCY` | how long ago this series was last played (72 h half-life) |
| `FREQUENCY` | how often you come back to it |
| `COMPLETION` | whether you usually finish it (abandoned titles rank lower) |
| `TIME_OF_DAY`, `WEEKDAY` | circular statistics over when you normally watch it |
| `QUEUE_AGE` | how recently you added it (14-day half-life) |
| `BIAS` | baseline appetite for anything new |

Training is 40 SGD epochs with L2, fitted on a background thread after each finished session, using
only events that preceded each sample (no peeking at the future). Fewer than 8 recorded playbacks
and the weights stay at their priors, which the Settings screen states plainly ("Learning" vs
"Personalised"). Probabilities are temperature-scaled (T = 1.7) so a nine-input model never claims
99 % certainty.

The prediction changes the *plan*, not the cache limit: the top pick gets
`base × (0.5 + probability)` clamped to 2–20 minutes, two runner-ups get a 2-minute warm start so a
wrong guess wastes very little, and the periodic pass only runs on an unmetered network while
charging (`SmartPrefetchWorker`). With smart pre-cache off, the app behaves exactly as before:
everything you queue is cached with your configured window.

## Build

Requirements: JDK 17, Android SDK Platform 35 + Build-Tools 35
(`compileSdk = 35`, `targetSdk = 34`, `minSdk = 24`).

```bash
# 1. Point Gradle at your SDK (Android Studio does this for you).
echo "sdk.dir=$HOME/Android/Sdk" > local.properties   # or export ANDROID_HOME=...

# 2. Build the debug APK.
./gradlew assembleDebug

# 3. Run the unit tests (pure-JVM, no device needed).
./gradlew testDebugUnitTest
```

The APK lands in `app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk`. CI runs the same two commands on
every pull request and uploads the APK as the `stream-buddy-debug-apk` artifact.

Everything in `stream/` (except `PreCacheEngine`/`StreamFetcher`), `ai/` and `util/` is plain JVM
Kotlin with no Android dependencies, which is what `app/src/test` exercises — including the
predictor and its training loop.

## Tests

`./gradlew testDebugUnitTest` runs 59 unit tests covering:

* master/media playlist parsing, `#EXT-X-BYTERANGE`, `#EXT-X-MAP`, BOM/CRLF handling,
  relative/protocol-relative/awkward URL resolution,
* DRM detection (including "AES-128 is not DRM"),
* pre-play segment planning for VOD and live,
* URL validation and stream-kind detection,
* series/episode parsing (`S02E05`, `2x05`, `Episode 5`, movies as their own series) and
  "is this the next episode" logic,
* the predictor: ranking, explanations, cold start, training convergence, that the untrainable
  `QUEUE_AGE` weight is left at its prior, temperature-bounded probabilities,
* prefetch depth planning (top pick vs. warm starts vs. nothing at all),
* formatting helpers.

## Design notes

* **One cache instance per process.** Media3 requires a single `SimpleCache` per directory, so
  `CacheManager` is a singleton used by both playback and pre-caching. That is what makes
  pre-cached segments show up instantly in the player.
* **Cache keys line up.** Media3's default cache key is the `DataSpec` key, falling back to the
  resolved URI string. Pre-caching builds the same `DataSpec` ExoPlayer's HLS chunk source builds
  (`new DataSpec(uri, byteRangeOffset, byteRangeLength)`), so both sides write and read the same
  key, position and length — playback finds the pre-cached blocks.
* **Manifests bypass the cache.** HLS reloads its media playlist every target duration; caching
  those responses would serve a stale playlist and stall live playback.
* **No foreground service.** WorkManager runs the pre-cache job with a network constraint; it is
  resumable, so a stopped job simply continues where it left off on retry.
* **The model never decides *what* you may watch** — it only decides what is worth downloading
  early. It is trained on this device's history, stored in SharedPreferences as nine doubles, and
  reset from Settings. With no history it degrades to fixed priorities rather than guessing wildly.

## Roadmap

* DASH pre-caching (MPD parsing + segment templates).
* `MediaSessionService` for background audio and lock-screen controls.
* Per-stream cache eviction, configurable cache budget.
* HLS variant switching during pre-cache (currently lowest or highest only).
* Train on more signals (cast history, time-to-first-play) and calibrate the probabilities against
  real outcomes once there is usage data; a neural model is not worth it at this input size.
